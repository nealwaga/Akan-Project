    <h1>What This Application Is About</h1>

    <p>Hello there!</p>
    <p>What my application basically does is: take your birth-date and calculates which day of the week you were born, and depending on your gender output, your Akan name will be displayed.</p>
    <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first names as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.</p>
