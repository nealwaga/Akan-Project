Akan-Project

My application basically takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs, their Akan names.
(Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. You will get to see it once you use the application.)

Solely by me, Neal Waga. 

It currently does not require any setup or installation requirements. All you need to do is get the link of the website.
It is super easy to understand.

THere are no bugs or issues that would corrupt your system, so don't worry.

I managed to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. I also tried using JSON array & dummy data, although I found a bit of difficulty.

If you encounter problems, have questions or want to pitch in ideas or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact me at waganeal@gmail.com
It will be much appreciated.
